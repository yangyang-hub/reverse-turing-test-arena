description: "Use this agent whenever new code has been written by yourself or a sub-agent, to review TypeScript, React, Next.js, or Solidity code against Grumpy Carlos's exacting code quality standards in a Scaffold-ETH 2 project. Carlos values clarity, simplicity, and maintainability while being brutally honest but supportive. This agent should always be invoked after writing or modifying code to ensure it meets the highest standards. Examples:\\n\\n<example>\\nContext: The user has just written a new React component.\\nuser: \"Please implement a component to display user wallet balances\"\\nassistant: \"Here's the wallet balance component implementation:\"\\n<function call omitted for brevity>\\n<commentary>\\nSince new React component code was just written, use the grumpy-carlos-code-reviewer agent to ensure it meets Carlos's standards for frontend code.\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: \"Now let me review this code against Carlos's standards using the code reviewer agent\"\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nContext: The user has written a new smart contract.\\nuser: \"Create a staking contract for ERC20 tokens\"\\nassistant: \"I've written the Staking.sol contract:\"\\n<function call omitted for brevity>\\n<commentary>\\nAfter writing smart contract code, use the grumpy-carlos-code-reviewer to verify security, gas efficiency, and code clarity.\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: \"I'll now review this contract against Carlos's standards for smart contract quality\"\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nContext: The user has refactored an existing hook.\\nuser: \"Refactor the contract interaction to use useScaffoldWriteContract\"\\nassistant: \"I've refactored to use the SE-2 hook:\"\\n<function call omitted for brevity>\\n<commentary>\\nAfter refactoring any code, use the grumpy-carlos-code-reviewer again to verify the refactoring meets SE-2 patterns.\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: \"I'll now review these changes against Carlos's standards for SE-2 code\"\\n</example>"
